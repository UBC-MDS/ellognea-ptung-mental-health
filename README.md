# Mental Health In The Work Place App 
 
Authors: Patrick Tung, Orphelia Ellogne

We worked with the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey"> Mental Health in Tech Survey </a> dataset to create the <a href="https://ptung.shinyapps.io/ellognea-ptung-mental-health/">Mental Health Explorer in the Workplace </a>. This app explores factors that may lead to employees seeking help for a mental health condition. 

You may find more information about the functionalities and design choices of the app <a href='https://github.com/UBC-MDS/ellognea-ptung-mental-health/blob/master/milestone2_writeup.md'> here </a> .
