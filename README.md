# Mental Health In The Work Place.

## Section 1 - Overview
-------------------------

The productivity loss and absences from work due to mental health might negatively impact a business and cost employers a significant amount of money. We would like to build a data visualization application that will allow employers to explore factors that may lead to employees seeking help for a mental health condition. The application will show the distributions of treatment sought (Yes/No) per gender, age, family history, work location (remote or office), benefits provided, observed consequences, and available resources. Users will also be able to filter the data based on specified countries so that data can be viewed for different geographical locations and cultures. Ultimately, we hope that our application will help employers effectively design company policies and develop mental wellness programs, therefore creating a safe and productive working environment where employees will not be afraid to discuss their mental health issues and seek treatment.

## Section 2 - Description of the Data
------------------------

We will be visualizing a survey dataset consisting of about 1200 entries that measure the attitude of employees towards mental health issues. Each of our entries will have 10 variables associated to whether an employee has sought treatment for their mental health issues. Our visualizations will consider the following variables from the survey:  employees’ age (Age) and gender (Gender), the country they are working in (Country), whether they have a family history of mental issues (family_history), details about how their work may affect their decision to seek help (work_interfere, remote_work, benefits, seek_help, obs_consequence), and finally, whether or not they have sought treatment (treatment). With this information, we will also filter the visualized data further by categorizing them by country, personal (i.e. age, gender) vs work environment (i.e. benefits, seek-help).


## Section 3 - Usage scenario & tasks
-------------------
The human resources team of company ABC has been tasked with organizing a seminar on mental health treatment to encourage employees to seek help when needed. They’ve learnt from experience that focused group discussions are the most productive because they allow to share messages targeted at specific groups. To do so, they would like to explore a dataset in order to identify factors that may lead to employees seeking help for a mental health condition. When they log on to the “Mental Health Treatment” app, they will first choose the country they are based in. This is important and very useful for multinational companies because mental health issues may be perceived differently across cultures. Then, they will be able to access the distributions of treatment sought (Yes/No), per gender, age, family history, work location (remote or office), benefits provided, observed consequences, and available resources. When they do so, they notice 3 main trends:

1. Men seem to be less likely to seek treatment for mental health issues than women 
2. Employees working remotely are more likely to treat their mental health condition than office-based employees
3. Younger employees appear to be less likely to seek help than older employees

They conclude that the focused groups split will be based on age, gender and work location. In addition, they will adjust the content of their presentation accordingly, to make it as relevant as possible for each group.
