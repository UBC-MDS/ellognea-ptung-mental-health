### Section 1

The productivity loss and absences from work due to mental health might negatively impact a business and cost employers a significant amount of money.  We would like to build a data visualization app that will allow employers to explore factors leading to employees seeking help  for a mental health condition. The app will show the distribution of treatment sought (Yes/No) per gender, age, family history, work location (remote or not), benefits provided, observed consequences, available resources. Employers will be able to filter the data on their specific countries. 
We hope that our app will help employers to effectively design their mental health awareness programs, thus creating a safe work place where employees are not afraid to discuss their mental health issues and seek treatment. 

### Section 2

We will be visualizing a survey dataset consisting of around 1200 entries that measure the attitudes of employees towards mental health issues. Each of our entries will have 9 variables associated to whether or not that particular employee has or has not sought treatment for their mental health issues. Our visualizations will consider the following variables from the survey: their age (Age), their gender (Gender), the country they are working in (Country), whether or not they have family history for mental issues (family_history), details about how their work may affect their decision to seek help (work_interfere, remote_work, benefits, seek_help, obs_consequence), and finally, whether or not they have sought treatment (treatment). With this information, we can perhaps filter the visualized data further by categorizing them through country, or personal vs work environment.
