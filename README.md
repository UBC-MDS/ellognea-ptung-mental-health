## Section 1 - Overview
-------------------------

The productivity loss and absences from work due to mental health might negatively impact a business and cost employers a significant amount of money. We would like to build a data visualization application that will allow employers to explore factors that may lead to employees seeking help for a mental health condition. The appication will show the distributions of treatment sought (Yes/No) per gender, age, family history, work location (remote or office), benefits provided, observed consequences, and available resources. Users will also be able to filter the data based on specified countries so that data can be viewed given different geographical locations. Ultimately, we hope that our application will help employers effectively design company policies and develop mental wellness programs, therefore creating a safe working environment where employees will not be afraid to discuss their mental health issues as well as seek for treatment.

## Section 2 - Description of the Data
------------------------

We will be visualizing a survey dataset consisting of around 1200 entries that measure the attitudes of employees towards mental health issues. Each of our entries will have 10 variables associated to whether or not that particular employee has or has not sought treatment for their mental health issues. Our visualizations will consider the following variables from the survey: their age (Age), their gender (Gender), the country they are working in (Country), whether or not they have family history for mental issues (family_history), details about how their work may affect their decision to seek help (work_interfere, remote_work, benefits, seek_help, obs_consequence), and finally, whether or not they have sought treatment (treatment). With this information, we can perhaps filter the visualized data further by categorizing them through country, or personal vs work environment.
