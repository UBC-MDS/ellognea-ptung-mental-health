### Section 2

We will be visualizing a survey dataset consisting of around 1200 entries that measure the attitudes of employees towards mental health issues. Each of our entries will have 9 variables associated to whether or not that particular employee has or has not sought treatment for their mental health issues. Our visualizations will consider the following variables from the survey: their age (Age), their gender (Gender), the country they are working in (Country), whether or not they have family history for mental issues (family_history), details about how their work may affect their decision to seek help (work_interfere, remote_work, benefits, seek_help, obs_consequence), and finally, whether or not they have sought treatment (treatment). With this information, we can perhaps filter the visualized data further by categorizing them through country, or personal vs work environment.
