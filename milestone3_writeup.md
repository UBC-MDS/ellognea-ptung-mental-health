# Milestone 3 Writeup


### Reflection on Usability
Reflect on the usability of your app. How easy or hard was it for your peers to use your app? Did you expect them to use the app in they way they did?

We received lots of feedback, both positive and negative, during the feedback session of the labs regarding the overall usability of our application. In general, much of the feedback was that it was quite easy to use as everything is labeled neatly and there is not much ambiguity in the features/functionalities of our app. Our peers were able to navigate and utilize every little detail that we included in our app functionalities. The applications were not used in ways that we did not intend it to, and therefore we think that it was quite easy for them to use. This may be the case because our functionalities are quite simple. For example, we have a filter sidebar by where you can select what you would like to filter the data with, and we have different tabs that show different information. We do believe that the simpleness to our project was deliberately designed, so that there would be no confusion.
