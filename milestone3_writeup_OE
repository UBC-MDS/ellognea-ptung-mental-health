### Usability of the feedback received

Our reviewers used the mental health explorer app as intended. They understood from the fly-on-the wall cycle that it was an app that explores factors that lead to employees seeking treatment for a mental illness. As per their feedback, this was made easier by the variable descriptions tab that facilitates the interpretability of the plots. The features of the filters were also appreciated.
Overall, we received valuable suggestions that led to an improved app.  We made four main changes:

1-	We removed the variable descriptions tab and added the descriptions as tooltips to the data table. This allows the users to understand the column names without switching tabs. 
2-	We used ggplot faceting to fix the y-axis of our plots and removed the repetitive legend. The additional white space makes our app more pleasant and the former change facilitates comparisons between subplots.
3-	We made the width of the bars consistent . This makes it easier to identity a missing category.
4-	We made the filters more intuitive by moving the selectInput widgets below their corresponding checkboxes.

Add stacked bars to the graphs, for separating age groups... no ! unreasonable
use percentage instead of count ... unreasonable
