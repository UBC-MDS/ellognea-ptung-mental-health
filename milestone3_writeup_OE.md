### Usability of the feedback received and changed in project since Milestone 2

Our reviewers used the mental health explorer app as intended. They understood from the fly-on-the wall cycle that it was an app that explores factors that lead to employees seeking treatment for a mental illness. As per their feedback, this was made easier by the variable descriptions tab that facilitates the interpretability of the plots. The features of the filters were also appreciated.
Some reviewers suggested changing the y-axis from count to percentage and using stacked bars for comparison. However, we chose not to incorporate this feedback because the former does not add any new information and the latter is not appropriate for our app objective.
We, however, made four main changes:

1.	We removed the variable descriptions tab and added the descriptions as tooltips to the data table. This allows the users to understand the column names without going back and forth between tabs. 
2.	We used ggplot faceting to fix the y-axis of our plots and removed the repetitive legend. The additional white space makes our app more pleasant and the fixed y-axis facilitates comparisons between subplots.
3.	We made the width of the bars consistent. This makes it easier to identity a missing category.
4.	We made the filters more intuitive by moving the selectInput widgets below their corresponding checkboxes. 

Overall, we have received valuable suggestions that led to an improved app. We carefully considered each feedback while keeping in mind that visualizations should be simple and meaningful without overshadowing important information.
The fly-on-the-wall experience reiterated the importance of making an appealing standalone app that is easy to use.
